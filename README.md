# ESPN Fantasy League Score Bug for Greasemonkey
Changes the ESPN Fantasy Football League Scoreboard page to display match scores and stats. I suspect this script could be used for other ESPN fantasy leagues, but has only been tested with Fantasy Football.

The score bug is separated in two pieces, the match scores and the match stats. Both sections are on vivid magenta backgrounds so they can be easily keyed out. Match scores are updated live and match stats will be updated the next time a players team is displayed.

## Use Case
Since the background for both sections can be keyed out, I use OBS to overlay the score bug on to games and project a fullscreen preview on to my TV.

## Examples
